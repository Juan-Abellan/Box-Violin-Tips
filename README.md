# Box and Violin

## Background & Objectives

Same principle in this exercise, we are going to **recreate** plots from this [article](https://www.data-to-viz.com/story/OneNumSevCatSubgroupSevObsPerGroup.html).

To learn more **best practices** around Box or Violin plot read these **2 short articles**.

[Box-Plot](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/boxplot.html), [Violin_plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_plot)

### Grouped box plot

Start by recreating this plot from the article.
Make sure your plot uses the **tip percentage %** on the **Y axis**.
Your plot should present individual data points using **swarmplot**.

It's ok if your plot has different **aesthetics**, this will also be true for the **next exercises of the day**.

### Violin plot

We will recreate the following plot.

<img src="https://www.data-to-viz.com/story/OneNumSevCatSubgroupSevObsPerGroup_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="760">

Use seaborn violin plot option `split`, to have a violin with, on one side the **female** distribution and on the other side the **male** distribution.

Make sure you have the right **legend**, male and female.



## Data

You will work with the **tips** dataset.


## Tools

For this challenge, we will work with Jupyter Notebook and some Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib and Seaborn.
